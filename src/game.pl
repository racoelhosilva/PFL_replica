% The main predicate, play/0, must be in the game.pl file and must give access to the game menu,
% which allows configuring the game type (H/H, H/PC, PC/H, or PC/PC), difficulty level(s) to be used
% by the artificial player(s), among other possible parameters, and start the game cycle.

% initial_state(+GameConfig, -GameState)
% This predicate receives a desired game configuration and
% returns the corresponding initial game state. Game configuration includes the type of each player
% and other parameters such as board size, use of optional rules, player names, or other information
% to provide more flexibility to the game. The game state describes a snapshot of the current game
% state, including board configuration (typically using list of lists with different atoms for the different
% pieces), identifies the current player (the one playing next), and possibly captured pieces and/or
% pieces yet to be played, or any other information that may be required, depending on the game.

% display_game(+GameState)
% This predicate receives the current game state (including the player
% who will make the next move) and prints the game state to the terminal. Appealing and intuitive
% visualizations will be valued. Flexible game state representations and visualization predicates will
% also be valued, for instance those that work with any board size. For uniformization purposes,
% coordinates should start at (1,1) at the lower left corner

% move(+GameState, +Move, -NewGameState)
% This predicate is responsible for move validation and
% execution, receiving the current game state and the move to be executed, and (if the move is valid)
% returns the new game state after the move is executed.
move(GameState, Move, NewGameState) :-

% predicate should not print anything to the terminal.

% value(+GameState, +Player, -Value)
% This predicate receives the current game state and returns a

% choose_move(+GameState, +Level, -Move)
% This predicate receives the current game state and
% returns the move chosen by the computer player. Level 1 should return a random valid move. Level
% 2 should return the best play at the time (using a greedy algorithm), considering the evaluation of
% the game state as determined by the value/3 predicate. For human players, it should interact with
% the user to read the move.
